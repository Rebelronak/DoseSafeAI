### Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code

style(frontend): improve button hover animations
refactor(backend): optimize database queries
test(ocr): add unit tests for image preprocessing
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=.

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_ocr.py
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Integration Testing
- Test the complete prescription scanning pipeline
- Verify API endpoints work correctly
- Ensure frontend-backend communication

## 📋 Code Style Guidelines

### Python (Backend)
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Use type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes

```python
def extract_medications(text: str, confidence_threshold: float = 0.8) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Extract medication information from OCR text.
    
    Args:
        text: Raw OCR text from prescription image
        confidence_threshold: Minimum confidence score for extraction
        
    Returns:
        List of dictionaries containing medication information
    """
    pass
```

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)
- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Write JSDoc comments for complex functions

```javascript
/**
 * Process image scan and extract medication data
 * @param {File} file - Prescription image file
 * @param {number} patientAge - Patient age for age-specific warnings
 * @param {string} patientCondition - Patient medical condition
 * @returns {Promise<ScanResult>} Processed scan results
 */
const processImageScan = async (file, patientAge, patientCondition) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

## 🔐 Security Guidelines

- Never commit API keys or sensitive data
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

## 📱 Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Mobile Development
- Test on both iOS and Android devices
- Ensure touch interactions work properly
- Optimize for different screen sizes
- Consider offline functionality

### Web Accessibility
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Add proper ARIA labels
- Test with screen readers
